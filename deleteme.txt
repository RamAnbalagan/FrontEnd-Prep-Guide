1) Write a function to flatten an array - both recursively and iteratively.
2) Given 2 identical DOM trees (but not equal ) and one element of the first DOM tree,
 how would find this element in the second dom tree
3) Write an emitter class 
   emitter = new Emitter () 
   should support the following :
   --------
   a)Subscribing to events - sub = emitter.subscribe('event_name',callback)
   b)emiting events - emiiter.emit('event_name',foo,bar)
   c) unsubscribing existing subscriptions by releasing them - sub.release()

7) items= {
               color : 'red',
               type : 'tv',
               age: 18 
              },
              {
               color : 'red',
               type : 'tv',
               age: 18 
              },
              {
               color : 'red',
               type : 'tv',	
               age: 18 
              }
  function excludeItems ( items, excludes ) {
     excludes.forEach(pair =>{items = items.filter(item => item[pair.k] === item[pair.v]);
  });return items;}

  excludes = [ {k:'color', v:'silver'}, {k:'type', v:'tv},...]

 a) describe what the function is doing 
 b) what is wrong with that function ? 
 c) how would you optimize it?
 
8) Design and code a poll widget. Know ur positioning and diff between the 4 css values in and out.
9) Calendar challenge
10) Given a grid of characters output a decoded message. the message for the following would be 'IROCKA' . (diagonally down right 
    and diagonally up right if you can't go futher-- you continue doing this ) 
   I B C A L K A D R F C A E A G H O E L A D
    3x7 grid .
11)Event bubbling 
12) Debounce
13) If you have 500 revisions of a program, write a program that will find and return the first BAD revision given a isBAD(revision i) function
14)a) Givn a picture how would you hide / show a child picture on hovering it's parent ?
   b) How would you ensure clicking on this picture would goto a specific link ?
   c) how would you ensure the child is positioned in the top right of the parent picture.
15) Implement a Simple observable in JS 
16) Given an input array and another array that describes a nwe index for each element , mutate the input array so that each element ends up in their new index,
   discuss the runtime and also how can you be sure there wont be infinite loops.
17) Convert Roman numerals(string)to sum(number).
18) Animate a given element using JS across any given time frame
19) Write a function to compute the square root of a number without using anu built in functions.
20) Given 2 very large numbers each of which is so large it can be represented as an arry of integers, write a function to multiply them.
21) Write a function to display a JSON string in pretty format
22) What is the difference between Map and For In 
23) Implement a simple store class with set ( Node, value ) . Get(Node) and Has(node) methods. which stores a given numner of nodes with correspponding values.
24) Build a puzzle game with JS
25) Using HTML and CSS how would you show another image , aligned to the bottom right when the user hovers the image. Ex: the facebook edit profile picture icon
26) You are given an array of N elements in the form "property1: value1; property2: value2;...;propertyX: valueX;"
for some some N and any X. There is also another array of M elements of the form "property: value".
You are supposed to write an algorithm to remove every element in the N length array that has a "property: value" pair
in the M length array.
The trick is that the most intuitive solution of iterating through the M array and filtering the N array at each element is already written. You must come up with a solution that solves the problem in less than O(NM) time.  

27) 
We have an array of objects A and an array of indexes B.
Reorder objects in array A with given indexes in array B. Do not change array A's length. 

example:

var A = [C, D, E, F, G];
var B = [3, 0, 4, 1, 2];

sort(A, B);
// A is now [D, F, G, C, E];
  
28) 
Given a value N, return the corresponding string according to this pattern.
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211  

29)
given two arrays, one of them is a map to another,
 you need to traverse and exclude from array objects according to the map,
 in general they expect from you to build an map object from key+value but you have to use ES6 MAP where key
 can be stored as object and not as string or ASCII coded string.
 The second question was about setTimeout browser api,
 you will be asked to clean all timeouts, the answer is to override setTimeout and store all of them in stuck and clean them if needed.
