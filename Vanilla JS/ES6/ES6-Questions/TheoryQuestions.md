# ES6 Trivia Questions
1.**Explain the concept of ES6 promises to a 5 year old**
  `Imagine that your daddy promised you to buy you some ice-cream once you finished your homework. Also promised you to take you to the park once you finish eating your vegetables for the day.Now you can do them in any order you like and once you are done with either one, you come back to dad and let him know and you will then get ur reward(.then()). Incase you are not able to do any of them, then you let him know and he will help you (.fail() )`

2) **What are the advantages of using ES6 maps over objects?**
  * You can use any values as keys in maps, objects only support Strings
  * A Map object can iterate its elements in insertion order.
  * Map.size() exists, object.size() does'nt.
   
3) **What are the advantages of using ES6 sets over arrays** ?
  Set doesn’t really have a huge clear advantage over Array, except in specific scenarios such as when we want to maintain “distinct” data with minimum effort, or to work with a lot of distinct data sets together using the most basic set operations, without the need of direct accessing element.

    Otherwise, Array should always the choice. Reason? Less CPU work to fetch the element when it is needed.
